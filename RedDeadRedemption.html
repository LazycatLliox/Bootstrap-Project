            The Story Of Red Dead Redemption 

        </h2>



        </div>

        <main>
            <p>Set in 1911, Rockstar’s frontier epic centres around John Marston: a former outlaw who’s trying to go on the (admittedly violent) straight and narrow. After being strong-armed by corrupt government officials, John is forced to bring in his former criminal chums dead or alive… with an emphasis on the daisy-pushing option.</p> 

            <p>A fundamentally decent man, Marston has no choice but to betray his old brothers-in-arms after Edgar Ross kidnaps his wife Abigail and teenage son, Jack. The dastardly Ross is director of the fledgeling Bureau of Investigation, and sees John as the ideal man to rid the dying West of its few remaining bandits.</p> 
                
            <p>Before stepping off the boat in New Austin, Marston spent his teens and 20s in Dutch van der Linde’s gang – a section of his life you’ll see in great detail in Red Dead Redemption 2. The son of a surly Scot who lost both eyes in a bar brawl and the prostitute he fell in love with, John was forced to fend for himself at a young age after both his parents passed while he was still a child.</p>

            <h2>Kill Bill</h2>

            <p>We first meet John in 1911, twelve years after the events of Red Dead Redemption 2, which, despite what the title suggests, is actually a prequel. The gunslinger’s main goal is simple: he must either capture or slaughter three prominent members of his old gang. </p>

            <p>First up on the kill list is Bill Williamson, a beardy, not terribly bright scoundrel. Next, there’s Javier Escuella, a scheming low-life who hightails it to Mexico upon hearing the government are after him. Finally, there’s Dutch van der Linde; John’s former boss, and a charming sociopath who ran his gang like a Wild West Robin Hood.</p>

            <p>Though Dutch and Bill’s screen time in Red Dead Redemption is low, the upcoming prequel will see you living day in and day out with the pair as you step into the spurs of Arthur Morgan, Dutch’s loyal second-in-command.</p>

            <p> John has no love for the government, the outlaw has little affection for his old gang members, either. After all,they left him for dead during a failed bank robbery in 1906. And as Red Dead Redemption 2 will no doubt show us, they’re also responsible for the funky scar plastered across Marston’s grizzled mug. </p>

            <h2>New Austin, new problems</h2>

            <p>John’s outlaw-assaulting quest doesn’t exactly enjoy the smoothest of starts. After tracking Williamson down to his temporary home at the heavily armed Fort Mercer, our cowboy chum is promptly shot in the stomach. Luckily for our boy and his bullet-ridden colon, he’s promptly picked up on the side of the road by one Bonnie McFarlane. Fierce, principled, and progressive, this ranch owner tends to John’s injuries and gives him a place to stay on her farm while he’s healing up. In return, Marston helps her patrol the ranch, which involves shooting coyotes and crop-stealing bunnies.</p>

            <p>Once he’s properly back on his feet, John travels across New Austin to the nearby town of Armadillo, where he quickly befriends the local sheriff. As he helps Marshal Johnson and his deputies wipe out criminals, John’s pistol-twirling pursuits lead him to cross paths will all manner of colourful characters.</p>

            <p>Among these strange allies is Nigel West Dickens: a crooked snake oil salesman who loves to peddle ‘miracle’ cures to anyone gullible enough to part with their dollars. Marston also makes friends with Seth (the aforementioned corpse lover) and Irish: a drunkard who harbours a legendary love of whisky and nonsense tails.</p>

            <p>After running various errands for these Western chancers, John eventually assembles a squad to attack Fort Mercer in the hopes of catching Bill Williamson. While a scheming potion peddler, a chronic drunk, and a Wild West take on Gollum may not exactly be the A-Team, between them Marston and his unlikely friends are able to storm the fort. Unfortunately for Marston, Bill has already fled before John can go postal with a mounted machine gun.</p>

            <h2>Once upon a time in Mexico</h2>

            <p>Soon after, John picks up a tip that Williamson and Javier Escuella are hiding in Mexico. Cue the world’s most homicidal raft journey, as John and Irish brave choppy waters and hails of gunfire before they dock on Mexican soil.</p>

            <p>Shortly after crossing the border, Redemption serves up arguably its most memorable scene: a haunting musical moment that whispers on the breeze as Marston gallops across the prairies of Mexico for the first time. José González’s ethereal Far Away is the perfect tune for the moment, brilliantly setting the scene of a stranger out of his depth in a foreign land.</p>

            <p>During his Mexican travels, John helps turn the tides of a civil war, teams up with an ageing, legendary gunslinger, and even finds time to fleece a train. After helping to overthrow a corrupt regime, Marston tracks down Escuella, whereby you’re free to either capture or kill the conniving hombre. With the help of revolutionary Abraham Reyes, John also finally finds Williamson, and promptly puts a bullet in his former gang pal.</p>

            <h2>Great Plains drifter</h2>

            <p>With two of his targets either in jail or sleeping with the frontier fishies, Marston returns to America. In the final Great Plains area, John is given a taste of modern life, as the cobbled streets of Blackwater chip away at the Old West’s decaying deserts.</p>

            <p>Nevermore out of his depth, Marston soon befriends an eccentric professor, who is only too happy to lead John to Dutch… providing you save his bacon during a rooftop sniper shootout.</p>

            <p>His outlaw-ending journey almost complete, John and his government harassers track down van der Linde at the outlaw’s base among the towering pines of Tall Trees forest. After Marston mows down his men, he finally comes face to face with his former leader, yet he never gets the chance to pull the trigger. Not only is Dutch a gun-toting romantic, he’s also a martyr, as he proves when he flings himself off a cliff before Marston can bring him in. Ouch.</p>
